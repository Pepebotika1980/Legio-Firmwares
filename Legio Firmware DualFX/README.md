Firmware for Legio modules from Noise Engineering. This firmware includes three effects: a distortion filter, a delay emulating the Roland RE-301, and a shimmer reverb. You'll find the .bin file, which you can load, on the Noise Engineering website, along with screenshots showing how the firmware works. The idea is to keep improving it and implementing as many features as possible to maximize its capabilities. I hope you like it.
